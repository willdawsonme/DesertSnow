    <title>The Loneliest Human in the Universe</title>
    <content>My grandfather was probably as big an influence on me as anyone. He was a farmer in the upper part of the state of Michigan. He actually homesteaded the land. My granddad had a team of horses and everything was done with them. Back then it was one guy against the dirt on his farm and against Mother Nature trying to make a living out of owning a farm. I used to go up there and spend the summers with him on the farm and what I got from him was a sense of responsibility and a sense of perseverance and dedication to the job at hand.</content>

    <title>The Rise of the Snapchat Celebrity</title>
    <content>Snapchat is big, we’re talking $4 billion big. This follows a trend of recent years with Social Media exploding that has seen successful IPOs from Facebook and Twitter, a buyout of Tumblr and even Google getting involved with Youtube and Google+. It’s fairly safe to say that in the developed world everyone uses social media, it’s where news breaks first, it’s where people communicate and how things go viral. (It’s probably equally safe to say we’re witnessing the beginning of a massive tech bubble, but that’s a topic for a different day).</content>

    <title>Apple's Beats Acquisition</title>
    <content>There’s been a lot of buzz recently about Apple’s Beats Acquisition—at $3.2 billion, it trumps all of Apple’s acquisition purchases in 2013 combined by a good $2.7 billion. This is such a huge sum of money and so uncharacteristic that I was pretty shocked. My tweet at the time was: “Don’t do it—this is as overpriced of a deal as the headphones themselves.” My opinion hasn’t really changed about the deal as a whole—I think it is grossly overpriced—but Apple knows exactly what it doing. As a company that has $100 billion laying around, cash honestly doesn’t mean much to them: the Beats acquisition is a risk mitigation strategy for entering the music streaming industry and if they can pay to reduce risk at the tune of $3.2 billion, they’ll most definitely do it.</content>
